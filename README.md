# Projects
A compilation of coding projects, both personal and academic, that demonstrate my strong coding proficiency.

**eec-gnn**

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook I wrote as part of my research project in Spring 2021 under the supervision of Professor Marynel Vazquez. This notebook provided important insights on errors our GNN model was making and created visualizations used in the paper and submission video for ICMI 2021. It also contains the published paper at ICMI 2021 for which I am co-author.

**intent**

This folder contains my project on AI-driven media forensics to detect fake news under Professor Abhinav Shrivastava at the AI Lab@The University of Maryland in Summer 2019.

**“Thrive,” iOS App for Mental Wellness:** https://github.com/zane-ice/thrive

Co-created an easy-to-use and intuitive iOS app to aggregate health information and on-campus resources for use by students at Phillips Exeter Academy; designed to help alleviate students’ mental stress by redressing their lack of awareness and reluctance to fully utilize health resources; built using XCode with SwiftUI and GitHub.

**macro_processer**

This folder contains code for an assignment for a Systems Programming course at Yale. The assignment was to create a TeX-like macro processor. It demonstrates my knowledge of C, memory allocation, and data structures.

**bank**

This folder contains code for an assignment for an Object-Oriented Programming course at Yale. It demonstrates my knowledge in Python, OOP, exceptions and logging, and GUIs.
